## 🔧 Configuration

### OpenAI Mode Toggle:

- **Live Mode**: `USE_OPENAI=true` - Uses real OpenAI API (~$0.002/analysis)

### Database:

- **Mock Fallback**: Works even if database is down

## 💡 Why Credits Weren't Showing Up:

The issue was that your $5 OpenAI credits were being rapidly consumed by:
1. **Rate Limit Errors**: Multiple rapid API calls
2. **GPT-4 Access Issues**: Your plan may not include GPT-4
3. **No Environment File**: Server was using fallbacks

### Solutions Implemented:
- ✅ **Mock Mode**: Preserves credits during development
- ✅ **Proper Environment**: All variables configured
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks prevent loops
- ✅ **Usage Tracking**: Clear indicators when credits used

## 🚀 Next Steps:

### To Enable Live OpenAI Mode:
1. `cd ai-sales-platform/server`
2. `node toggle-mock-mode.js` 
3. Restart server: `PORT=3007 node server.js`
4. ⚠️ **Note**: This will consume credits (~$0.002 per analysis)

### To Keep Mock Mode (Recommended for Development):
- Current setup is perfect for testing
- All features work with template responses
- Zero cost, instant results
- Switch to live mode only when ready for production

## 🎯 Current Configuration Summary:

- **Database**: 📊 MongoDB Atlas Connected
