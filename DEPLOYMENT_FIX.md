# ðŸš€ PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT FIX

## Issue Resolution: kalm.live Frontend-Backend Connection

### Changes Made:
âœ… Updated `client/src/config.ts` to use Railway backend URL in production
âœ… Fixed API endpoint configuration for kalm.live deployment
âœ… Backend server optimized for Railway deployment

### Configuration Update:
```javascript
// client/src/config.ts
const BASE_URL = isDevelopment 
  ? 'http://localhost:3010' 
  : 'https://web-production-e7159.up.railway.app'
```

### Next Steps After Deployment:

1. **Verify Frontend Deployment:**
   - Visit https://kalm.live
   - Check browser console for correct baseUrl
   - Ensure API calls reach Railway backend

2. **Update Environment Variables:**
   - Set VITE_API_URL in Vercel environment variables
   - Ensure Railway has correct production Stripe keys
   - Verify all environment variables are set

3. **Test Full Functionality:**
   - User registration/login
   - Payment processing
   - Transcript analysis features

### Expected Result:
âœ… Frontend connects to Railway backend
âœ… All API endpoints functional
âœ… Payment system operational
âœ… Real-time features working # Last updated: Wed Jun  4 18:48:20 BST 2025
